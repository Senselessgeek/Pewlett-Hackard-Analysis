# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## The Silver Tsunami

### Overview
  The purpose of the requested analysis to to furture proof Pewlett Hackard against the influx of employee attrition.  Taking a series of data sets and filtering them through SQL queries to present actionable data to prevent the colapse of our great company to the "silver tsunami".


### Results
  - A large chunk of our work force is about to retire. (around 40k employees)
  - 'Senior Engineer's and 'Senior Staff' make up the bulk of incoming attrition.
  - We will need to hire 40k new engineers, but ~1500 current employees qualify to move into a "mentorship role" part time.
  - We will only need to find 2 managers to replace current staff about to retire.
  
### Summary
  The current landscape of our workforce is about to change drastically due to ~40k employees reaching retirement age, and not near enough employees to stick around to mentor the future generation of workforce.  These are rough times indeed
